# web-fundamentals
When you “surf the web” you use a web browser, and in doing so, computers begin to talk to one another in their own language known as HTTP. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) was created by Tim Berners Lee, and it is how computers exchange information between each other. When you type in a web address into your browser and the page is loading, your computer (the client) is speaking to another computer (the server) in HTTP and asking for the information. Then in order to for the computer understand that information and display it correctly, web pages are written in a language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language).

In order to pull up a web page, you type in a formula-like series of letters (or numbers) called a URL. A URL is the web address for a website which can be entered at the top of the web browser page like. For example, http://www.google.com/pacman. The browser will then display the text, images, etc. that are on that web page. When a web address is entered into a browser, you will see http:// which enable your computer to pull up your desired web page from another computer, and the conversation begins between client and server.

The Web itself is a collection of interconnected information such as web pages (or websites, which have multiple web pages within), videos, photographs, etc., and all this is accessible through using the internet. The internet is a network of computers which allow you to use applications like the Web (among others) to also do things like send text, images, etc., to other computers, and essentially other people. You wouldn’t be able to access http://www.google.com/pacman without it.
